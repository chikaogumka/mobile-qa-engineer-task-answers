| Data driven testing entails using a set of prepared data to run defined test scenarios in a way that requires dynamic data input into the system in consideration during testing. This method of testing validates the test results after runs against another dataset which should be a source of truth. |  Data driven testing entails using a set of prepared data to run defined test scenarios in a way that requires dynamic data input into the system in consideration during testing.

| Key concepts includes test data seperation where test scripts are seperated from test data, parameterization where test scripts are designed to accept parameters, Data sources where data comes from, iterative Execution where test cases are executed iteratively and Validation of tests results | Key concepts includes User stories that describes how application should behave, using Gherkin GIVEN-WHEN-THEN-AND/BUT to define app's behaviour without detailing how the functionality is implemented, creating scenarios from all user stories, Collaborating with other stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding, Automating user stories  |
